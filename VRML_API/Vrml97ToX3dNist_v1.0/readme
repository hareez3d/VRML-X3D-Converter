This is a software to tranlate vrml97 file to x3d file. The translation is
based on the specification of "x3d-3.0.dtd".

After extracting the Vrml97Tox3dNist.tar, you will have a Vrml97ToX3dNist.jar, 
a Makefile (developed by Don Brutzman) and directories of "javasrc", "test", "class". 
In "test" directory, there is a C shell "v2x3dtest" and a pc batch file "v2x3dtest.bat", 
and some examples.  
In "javasrc" directory, there are source java programs. 
In "class" directory, there are class files.

To compile and create .jar file, type "make all".
To run the translator, simply go to the directory "test", and type:

v2x3dtest vrml97file x3dfile (for Unix)
v2x3dtest.bat vrml97file x3dfiel (for Windows)

At present it is only work for local file.
